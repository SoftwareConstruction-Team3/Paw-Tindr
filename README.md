# Paw-Tindr
Tinder-like class that allows dogs to pair with other dogs as play buddies and have fun(:

## Setting Up Firebase
Follow steps mentioned (here)[https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli?authuser=0&hl=en#install_the_firebase_cli]

## Running flutter project
- In a terminal in the paw_tindr folder, run the following command:
```
flutter build
flutter run
```

## Adding new changes to the respository
The changes are done in the (/lib)[./paw_tindr/lib] folder. This is the following hierarchy for structure:
- `models`
- `view`
- `controllers`
- `main.dart` -> as the main entry point

After building the app, flutter will compile the corresponding android and iOS code, (so there is no need to run the other stuff)
